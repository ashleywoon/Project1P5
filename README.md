# Project 1 P5
##by Ashley Woon
###Project 1 is a P5.js sketch created to teach a new guitar player about open strings, the notes produced when strummed, and the placement of these notes in sheet music. It is an interactive program navigated using a slider to move between notes (the different states). Another interactive option is to hover the mouse over different strings to navigate the notes. *Note: must click mouse to begin sound
##
###This sketch should be opened using a localhost.
###- In the Terminal Window type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 
###- Type: python -m http.server 8080 if you have Python version 3.
###- In your web-browser (testing in Chrome): http://localhost:8080/
###This should display p5.js sketch

####Note: I'm using 8080 as the port, but this can be other numbers as well.

Version 2 in progress. Advanced tab features are being added.
